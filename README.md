Hello! Thanks for stopping by. I am a Mechanical Engineering student @ UT-Austin where I work on robotics & autonomous vehicle research.
Even though I am an ME, we still work a lot with software! Here is a collection of projects that came about from my class projects, research, and significant personal projects.

See the blog at [https://rbowers97.github.io](https://rbowers97.github.io)

All notes & equations are graciously provided through my coursework at UT or research from other papers and textbooks. I try my best to provided a complete bibliography, but knowledge if often scattered so some things might slip through.
If you ever have any questions, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardo-bowers-92b276133/)!

**Big** thank you to my advisors and professors who have helped me in my learning, and to all my colleagues that saw the less-presentable side of these projects when things don't work.

For my personal projects, hobbies, and blog, see my personal github at NeonR3d.github.io. Also if for some reason I lose access to this account, I will post updates on my NeonR3d github & LinkedIn until I regain access.
